# IronMan
NYE party costume controller

Combine an Adafruit trinket and a pair of NeoPixels to control eye brightness and colour on a home-made Iron Man mask. Includes disco mode! 

Usage: connect power, cycle through modes with button presses. Short presses increment mode (off, white 1/3 brightness, white 2/3 brightness, white full brightness, red, green, blue); a long press (>3 seconds) switches to disco mode.
